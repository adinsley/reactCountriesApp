This small App was created whilst a Student at CodeClan.  On a user level it enables you to select a country based on region and it will then display data about the country.

I have used React JS to do this and it compares nicely to a app I also designed that uses just pure JS.

In making this I have worked to understand the way that react uses properities and states.

I have used the following node modules
babel
babel-loader
babel-preset-es2015
react
react-DOM

All should be able to be accessed through node install as all are contained in the package.JSON file.
